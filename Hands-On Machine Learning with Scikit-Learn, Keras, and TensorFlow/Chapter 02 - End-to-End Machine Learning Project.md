# Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of machine learning (ML), its definitions, applications, and challenges. Weâ€™ll be focusing on an end-to-end machine learning checklist.

### Machin Learning Checklist

### Frame the problem and look at the Big Picture

1. Define the objective in business terms.
2. How will your solution be used?
3. What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?
4. How should you frame this problem (supervised/unsupervised, online/offline, etc.)
5. How should performance be measured?
6. Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
7. What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?
8. What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?
9. Is human expertise available?
10. How would you solve the problem manually?
11. List the assumptions you or others have made so far.
12. Verify assumptions if possible.

### Get the Data

1. List the data you need and how much you need.
2. Find and document where you can get that data.
3. Check how much space it will take.
4. Check legal obligations, and get the authorization if necessary.
5. Get access to authorizations.
6. Create a workspace (with enough storage space).
7. Get the data.
8. Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself).
9. Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g., anonymized).
10. Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.).
11. Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!).

### Explore the Data

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

**Note:** *Try to get insights from a field expert on these steps.*

</aside>

1. Create a copy of the data for exploration (sampling it down to a manageable size if necessary).
2. Create a Jupyter Notebook to keep a record of your data exploration.
3. Study each attribute and its characteristics:
    - Name
    - Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)
    - % of missing values
    - Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)
    - Possibly useful for the task?
    - Type of distribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc.)
4. For supervised learning tasks, identify the target attribute(s).
5. Visualize the data.
6. Study the correlations between attributes.
7. Study how you would solve the problem manually.
8. Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply.
9. Identify extra data that would be useful (go back to "Get the Data" on page 502).
10. Document what you have learned.

### Prepare the Data

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

**Note:**

- Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset intact).
- Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:
    - So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset
    - So you can apply these transformations in future projects
    - To clean and prepare the test set
    - To clean and prepare new data instances
    - To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters
</aside>

1. Data cleaning:
    - Fix or remove outliers (optional).
    - Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median...) or drop their rows (or columns).
2. Feature selection (optional):
    - Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.
3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:
    - Discretize continuous features.
    - Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).
    - Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x^2, etc.).
    - Aggregate features into promising new features.
4. Feature scaling: standardize or normalize features.

### Shortlist Promising Models

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

Notes:

- If the data is huge, you may want to sample smaller training sets, so you can train many different models in a reasonable time (be aware that this penalizes complex models such as large neural nets or Random Forests).
- Once again, try to automate these steps as much as possible.
</aside>

1. Train many quick and dirty models from different categories (e.g., linear, naive, Bayes, SVM, Random Forests, neural net, etc.) using standard parameters.
2. Measure and compare their performance.
    - For each model, use N-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of their performance.
3. Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.
4. Analyze the types of errors the models make.
    - What data would a human have used to avoid these errors?
5. Have a quick round of feature selection and engineering.
6. Have one or two more quick iterations of the five previous steps.
7. Short-list the top three to five most promising models, preferring models that make different types of errors.

### Fine-Tune the system

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

**Notes:**

- You will want to use as much data as possible for this step, especially as you move toward the end of fine-tuning.
- As always automate what you can.
</aside>

1. Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation.
    - Treat your data transformation choices as hyperparameters, especially when you are not sure about them (e.g., should I replace missing values with zero or the median value? Or just drop the rows?).
    - Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using the Gaussian process priors, as described by Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle, and Ryan Adams ([https://goo.gl/PEFfGr](https://goo.gl/PEFfGr)))
2. Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often perform better than running them individually.
3. Once you are confident about your final model, measure its performance on the test set to estimate the generalization error.

> *Don't tweak your model after measuring the generalization error: you would just start overfitting the test set.*
> 

### Present your Solution

1. Document what you have done.
2. Create a nice presentation.
    - Make sure you highlight the big picture first.
3. Explain why your solution achieves the business objective.
4. Don't forget to present interesting points you noticed along the way.
    - Describe what worked and what did not.
    - List your assumptions and your system's limitations.
5. Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful visualizations or easy-to-remember statements (e.g., "the median income is the number-one predictor of housing prices").

### Launch!

1. Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs, write unit tests, etc.).
2. Write monitoring code to check your system's live performance at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops.
    - Beware of slow degradation too: models tend to "rot" as data evolves.
    - Measuring performance may require a human pipeline (e.g., via a crowdsourcing service).
    - Also monitor your inputs' quality (e.g., a malfunctioning sensor sending random values, or another team's output becoming stale). This is particulary important for online learning systems.
3. Retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate as much as possible).

### Technical Insights

- **Data Splitting**: Ensures no test data leakage using methods like `train_test_split` or stratified sampling.
- **Handling Non-Numerical Data**: Employs tools like `OrdinalEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder`.
- **Feature Engineering**: Combines or transforms features for better predictive performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: RMSE is emphasized for regression tasks, though alternatives like MAE may also be used.

### Frame the problem

<aside>

**Pipelines:**   Also called Data Processing Pipelines, these are pieces of code or proprietary software (*something like Dell Boomi or parts of Azure Data Factory*) that take in data on one end, and spit out the data in a different format on the other end. 

the best way to understand the possible steps in a data preparation pipeline:

- ***Estimators***
    - *Any object that estimates parameters based on a data set is known as an Estimator. For example, if you had a data set with lots of missing values, you could estimate what to fill these gaps with an imputer, and then you could choose to use the median of the dataset if appropriate.*
- ***Transformers***
    - *Any object that transforms a data set is known as a Transformer. For example, if you wanted to now fill those gaps in the data set previously mentioned with the mean, you would use a transformer to 'insert' the median wherever empty values were found.*
- ***Predictors***
    - *Any object that is capable of making predictions given a dataset is known as a Predictor. For example, a linear regression model is a predictor, using one feature to extrapolate another feature.*
</aside>

- ***What is the current solution?***
    
    A team of experts uses a rules-engine or their expert knowledge to try and predict the prices of houses. A rules engine is simply a piece of software that takes an input, follows a set of rules, and outputs the result. 
    
- ***What type of problem is this?***
    
    First, define the number of output variables (univariate, bivariate, multivariate), the machine learning paradigm of the problem, then the type of problem, the the algorithm(s) to be used:
    
    - **Supervised**
        - Regression - Predicting a value
        - Classification - Predict a class
    - **Unsupervised**
        - Clustering - Group ungrouped
        - Association Rule Mining - Find associations between two or more classes.
    - **Reinforcement**
        
        This will be a **Supervised Univariate Regression** task.
        
        - Supervised because weâ€™re given labeled data.
        - Univariate because weâ€™re just predicting one variable.
        - Regression because weâ€™re predicting a value.
        
        We can also use batch learning because we wonâ€™t be streaming in data.
        
- ***Select a Performance Measure***
    
    For regression problems, you have a couple of performance measures you can pick including:
    
    - **MAE** *(**M**ean **A**bsolute **E**rror)* -   *This doesnâ€™t penalize errors.*
    - **MSE** *(**M**ean **S**quared **E**rror) -*   *This penalizes errors.*
    - **RMSE** *(**R**oot **M**ean **S**quared **E**rror) -*   *This penalizes large errors.*
    - **R2** -   Measures the strength of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables by measuring the part of the variance of the dependent variable explained by the independent variable.
    - **RMSLE** *(**R**oot **M**ean **S**quared **L**og **E**rror)*
    - **MAPE** *(**M**ean **A**bsolute **P**ercentage **E**rror)*
    
    Weâ€™re going to use RMSE for this problem.
