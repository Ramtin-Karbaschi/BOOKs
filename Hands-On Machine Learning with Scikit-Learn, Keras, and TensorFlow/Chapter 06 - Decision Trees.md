# Chapter 6: Decision Trees

## **Foundations of Decision Trees**

Decision trees are interpretable models that partition data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure. They are widely used for classification and regression tasks due to their simplicity and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Splitting Criteria**:
    - For classification:
        - **Gini Impurity**:
            
            $$
            G = \sum_{k=1}^K p_k (1 - p_k)
            $$
            
        - **Entropy**:
            
            $$
            H = -\sum_{k=1}^K p_k \log_2(p_k)
            $$
            
    - For regression:
        - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
            
            $$
            \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y})^2
            $$
            
2. **Tree Depth and Overfitting**:
    - Decision trees can overfit if they grow too deep.
    - Mitigation techniques:
        - Pruning: Remove unnecessary branches.
        - Set maximum depth:
            
            ```python
            from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
            
            tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
            tree_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
            ```
            
3. **Interpretability**:
    - Decision trees are easy to visualize and interpret:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.tree import export_text
        
        tree_rules = export_text(tree_clf, feature_names=list(X.columns))
        print(tree_rules)
        ```

## **Limitations of Decision Trees**

While decision trees are intuitive, they have notable limitations:

- **Instability**: Small changes in data can lead to significantly different trees.
- **Bias Toward Dominant Features**: Features with more levels may dominate splits.
- **Overfitting**: Without constraints, trees can become overly complex.

These limitations highlight the need for ensemble methods.

## **Ensemble Methods: Combining Multiple Trees**

Ensemble methods aggregate predictions from multiple trees to improve performance and robustness.

### **Random Forests**

- **Bagging**:
    - Train multiple trees on random subsets of data:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
        
        rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_features="sqrt")
        rf_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        ```
        
    - Reduces variance and improves generalization.
- **Feature Subsetting**:
    - Each tree considers only a subset of features at each split, enhancing diversity.

### **Gradient Boosting**

- **Sequential Training**:
    - Each tree corrects errors made by previous trees:
        
        ```python
        from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
        
        gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)
        gb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        ```
        
- **Learning Rate**:
    - Controls the contribution of each tree:
        
        $$
        F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \eta h_m(x)
        $$
        
    - Smaller learning rates require more trees but improve accuracy.
- **Advanced Implementations**:
    - **XGBoost**: *Optimized for speed and scalability.*
        
        ```python
        from xgboost import XGBClassifier
        
        xgb_clf = XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)
        xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
        ```
        
    - **LightGBM**: *Efficient for large datasets.*

## **Practical Implementation**

This section provides hands-on examples for implementing decision trees and ensemble methods.

**Example:**

*Decision Tree Visualization*

```python
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plot_tree(tree_clf, feature_names=X.columns, filled=True)
plt.show()

```

*Random Forest for Regression*

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

rf_reg = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
rf_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = rf_reg.predict(X_test)
```

*Gradient Boosting for Classification*

```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

gb_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1)
gb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = gb_clf.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

## **Advanced Topics in Tree-Based Models**

This section explores advanced topics that extend the capabilities of tree-based models.

### **Feature Importance**

- Measure the contribution of each feature:
    
    ```python
    importances = rf_clf.feature_importances_
    for feature, importance in zip(X.columns, importances):
        print(f"{feature}: {importance:.2f}")
    ```
    

### **Handling Missing Data**

- Decision trees and ensembles are robust to missing values:
    
    ```python
    from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
    
    imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")
    X_train_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(X_train)
    ```
    

### **Ethical Considerations**

- Ensure fairness and transparency when using interpretable models in high-stakes applications.

## **Applications and Use Cases**
