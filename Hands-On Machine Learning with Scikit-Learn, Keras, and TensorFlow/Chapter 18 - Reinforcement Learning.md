# Chapter 18: Reinforcement Learning

## **Foundations of Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The goal is to maximize cumulative rewards over time through trial and error.

### **Key Components**

1. **Agent and Environment**:
    - The agent interacts with the environment by taking actions $a_t$, receiving observations $s_t$, and earning rewards $r_t$.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```python
    action = agent.select_action(state)
    next_state, reward, done = environment.step(action)
    ```
    
2. **Policy**:
    - A policy $\pi(a|s)$ defines how the agent selects actions based on its current state:
    
    $$
    \pi(a|s) = P(A_t = a | S_t = s)
    $$
    
3. **Reward Signal**:
    - Rewards guide the agent toward desirable behaviors. The goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward:
        
        $$
        G_t = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \dots = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{t+k+1}
        $$
        
        *where $\gamma \in [0, 1]$ is the discount factor.*
        
4. **Value Functions**:
    - State-value function $V(s)$ estimates the expected return starting from state $s$:
        
        $$
        V_\pi(s) = \mathbb{E}[G_t | S_t = s]
        $$
        
    - Action-value function $Q(s, a)$ estimates the expected return for taking action $a$ in state $s$:
        
        $$
        Q_\pi(s, a) = \mathbb{E}[G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a]
        $$
        
5. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:
    - Balance between exploring new actions and exploiting known good actions is crucial for optimal performance.

## **Key Algorithms in Reinforcement Learning**

This section explores foundational and advanced RL algorithms.

### **Value-Based Methods**

1. **Q-Learning**:
    - Updates the Q-value using the Bellman equation:
        
        $$
        Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \big[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \big]
        $$
        
    - *Implementation:*
        
        ```python
        def q_learning(env, episodes, alpha, gamma):
            Q = defaultdict(lambda: np.zeros(env.action_space.n))
            for _ in range(episodes):
                state = env.reset()
                done = False
                while not done:
                    action = epsilon_greedy(Q, state)
                    next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
                    Q[state][action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state][action])
                    state = next_state
        ```
        
2. **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**:
    - Uses neural networks to approximate Q-values:
        
        ```python
        model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation="relu", input_shape=(state_dim,)),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(action_dim)
        ])
        
        model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse")
        ```
        

### **Policy-Based Methods**

1. **Policy Gradient Methods**:
    - Directly optimize the policy by maximizing expected rewards:
        
        $$
        J(\theta) = \mathbb{E}{\tau \sim \pi\theta} \big[ \sum_t R_t \big]
        $$
        
    - *Implementation:*
        
        ```python
        def compute_policy_loss(states, actions, advantages):
            logits = policy_model(states)
            action_probs = tf.nn.softmax(logits)
            log_probs = tf.math.log(tf.reduce_sum(action_probs * actions, axis=1))
            return -tf.reduce_mean(log_probs * advantages)
        ```
        
2. **Actor-Critic Algorithms**:
    - Combine value-based and policy-based methods:
        
        ```python
        actor = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
        critic = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
        
        def train_actor_critic(states, actions, rewards, next_states):
            values = critic(states)
            next_values = critic(next_states)
            advantages = rewards + gamma * next_values - values
            actor_loss = compute_policy_loss(states, actions, advantages)
            critic_loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(rewards + gamma * next_values - values))
            return actor_loss, critic_loss
        ```
        

### **Advanced Algorithms**

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**:
    - Improves sample efficiency and training stability:
        
        $$
        L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \big[ \min(r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1-\epsilon, 1+\epsilon) \hat{A}_t) \big]
        $$
        
    - *Implementation:*
        
        ```python
        ratio = tf.exp(log_probs - old_log_probs)
        clipped_ratio = tf.clip_by_value(ratio, 1 - epsilon, 1 + epsilon)
        surrogate_loss = -tf.reduce_mean(tf.minimum(ratio * advantages, clipped_ratio * advantages))
        ```
        
- **Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)**:
    - Maximizes both expected reward and entropy for better exploration.

        ])
        model.compile(optimizer="adam", loss="mse")
        return model

    def select_action(self, state):
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
            return random.randint(0, self.action_dim - 1)
        q_values = self.model.predict(state[np.newaxis])
        return np.argmax(q_values)

    def train(self, batch_size):
        if len(self.replay_buffer) < batch_size:
            return
        batch = random.sample(self.replay_buffer, batch_size)
        states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)
        states = np.array(states)
        next_states = np.array(next_states)
        targets = rewards + self.gamma * np.max(self.model.predict(next_states), axis=1) * (1 - np.array(dones))
        target_q = self.model.predict(states)
        target_q[np.arange(batch_size), actions] = targets
        self.model.fit(states, target_q, verbose=0)
        if self.epsilon > self.epsilon_min:
            self.epsilon *= self.epsilon_decay
```
